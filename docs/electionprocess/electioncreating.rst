Creating an Election
====================

An election is created by the election authority (EA) using the UI of
the website.

For quick showcases or tests there is premade config file in
``examples\configs\`` which can be uploaded over the UI. With the
submit of the election creation form the election process is stared.
Most important a config file of the election is posted to the BB and
user files with secrets are created which should be handed to the
people eligibility to vote. The user secrets are json files which are
generated by the EA and dumped into the directory ``secrets\``. These
contain the link to the BB config and a secret which is used for the
integrity of the voter. The BB config can be viewed via the link in
one of those files. It should look something like this
``https://localhost:9002/api/getConfig?board_id=0"``. This can be used
to check if the election attributes are send to the bb and posted
there correctly.
